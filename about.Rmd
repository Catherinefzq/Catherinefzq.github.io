#### This is my first personal website, hosted by [Github](http://github.com).   
#### The source code can be found in our Data Science course [website](http://p8105.com/making_websites.html) and my github [repo](https://github.com/Catherinefzq/Catherinefzq.github.io).
#### I also learned from a [tutorial](http://nickstrayer.me/RMarkdown_Sites_tutorial/) by Nick Strayer and Lucy Dâ€™Agostino McGowan.
